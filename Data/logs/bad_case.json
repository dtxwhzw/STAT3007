They should really make it stick out or write clear instructions about it on the app. I imagine they try to make it subtle in order to not affect how the app looks, but it took a week to find it."}

{"true_label": "positive", "pred_label": "netural", "text": "great so far, it would be nice to allow the 5 buttons on the widget have an option to skip a day, week or month forward or backward, if i would like to look ahead i have to open one or two apps when it could be a button you set on the widget. maybe even a button option that allows one widget to switch between multiple calendars, just thought id include that suggestion."}
{"true_label": "positive", "pred_label": "netural", "text": "App is great, but I think there should be an option where you cannot exit from your timer. To maintain your focus more."}

{"true_label": "positive", "pred_label": "netural", "text": "This is the best time blocking app I've found, but it still has some significant pain points. I wish there was a desktop version, since creating/updating blocks would be 5x faster with a keyboard, mouse, and large screen. Editing would be faster too if blocks could temporarily overlap, and if routines were per day instead of per week."}
{"true_label": "negative", "pred_label": "netural", "text": "Great app but with a poor 12hr sync to Google Calendar (with no response from the developer in over a year, after an immediate response). If they cant see this is a problem, that is a problem."}

{"true_label": "netural", "pred_label": "negative", "text": "Doesn't meet my needs. I'm looking for a to-do app that allows me to see the tasks on my smart watch, click them done, then restore the tasks. Wanting to create a task list that I'll do repeatedly. I do not want to have to touch my phone. This app doesn't perform in a manner that supports that."}
{"true_label": "positive", "pred_label": "negative", "text": "Seems to have stopped sending reminder notifications, which makes the app kinda pointless for me. Edit 19/12/2020: issue seems to have resolved itself in subsequent updates."}
