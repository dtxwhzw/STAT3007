The only reason for not doing that is that I've been using your app for some time, before the new ad behavior, and it was fine. 2. Let's ignore my previous point for a minute and consider this: a \"Business Calendar\" app that sends me adds about online games that I can \"skip\" by stopping the app and then re-opening... Really, if I'm a business person what would I want with an online game for children? 3. You mentioned the apps has to be deployed daily. Tough luck! I did not make your release schedule, you did. Furthermore I would be perfectly fine using an older version of the app, with no ads, or far fewer adds. I really don't care about the latest releases, and most business people don't either.

So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month.", "label": ["netural"]}

It also will not sound when I have reminders set for many different times.

{"text": "I hate the gem system. I absolutely love the app and I've had a generally positive experience. I really think it's one of a kind and gamifying activities is the future. I've been playing for a while and I'm at a pretty high level now, but I can't help to notice that there isn't much left to do at the point that I am. Sure I can level up to infinity. Sure I can talk to people. But there is a lot of repetitiveness and I probably won't stick around for too long. It's too frustrating. The only thing left is to buy fun things with gems so that I can get gold, experience, and some cool rare items. So I decided to grind challenges. And I really did! Actual IRL GRINDING. The result - nothing at all. Why? Because Challenge rewards are luck based and/or rigged most of the time. Sure I did a lotta stuff IRL but not getting rewarded for it in-game kinda ruined it. I don't blame the devs for how Challenge rewards work at all, since rewarding depends on whoever creates the Challenges. But I do think there should be more ways to get gems without paying money. Paying IRL money becomes the only way to continue to have fun at a higher level. That's never a good thing if you want people to stick around. Here are some examples of instances where gem rewards can be implemented: when reaching a certain level, when completing difficult achievements, at a certain number of check-ins, through special in-game events (not RNG based events but events based on the actual effort that you put into tasks, for example). Rewarding the players' efforts is the best way to make them stick around. A balanced relationship between the value of the currency in-game and how difficult it is to get will never stop people from buying it with real money. In many cases it does the opposite. BUT It will also motivate people to progress and continue playing. It's a win win. A lotta people on the app preach the \"it's all about enjoying and improving yourself\" mentality. Sure, but if the aesthetic goal is to \"gamify\" your daily tasks, the app needs to behave like a game, right? And good replayable games are not repetitive and always reward hard work. This might be a bad take and I might be alone on this one but regardless I hope my feedback is useful! and yes, I have no life", "label": ["positive"]}

I have emailed about a new type of habit a couple times and have never heard anything back. User feedback is always good for making a great app even better", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "Great app! Finally something that motivates me. And you don't have to pay to use it :) One comment: I wish dragging and dropping tasks used the same solution as dragging and dropping items in a checklist. The way it is now makes it work inconsistently, because sometimes the interface thinks I want to scroll through the list and not move items around; because of this, it can be quite frustrating, and I move tasks around often to set or update my priorities. Other than that, great! great! great!", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "Its very helpful", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "Useful app, but with the latest update that incorporates language automatically into setting the time, it will delete times that are part of my reminder. For instance, if I want to say \"go to a meeting at 3:30\" it will delete the words \"at 3:30\" and set the remind to 3:30. So if I wanted my reminder to tell me what time the meeting was, I can't see it anymore. Too bad this option can't be turned off.", "label": ["positive"]}

{"text": "I really like the app but with the limited amount of time using it, I only have one thing I would wish it to be different is that when arranging task, it would be better to rank task according to the time being alarmed to the user then to the priority being set. Because in my case, the task I am supposed to be doing at say 9:30 A.M, low priority would be ranked after the task at 11 A.M, high priority. I suppose it is a matter of personal preference so it would be nice to change that in setting.", "label": ["positive"]}

{"text": "I hate the gem system. I absolutely love the app and I've had a generally positive experience. I really think it's one of a kind and gamifying activities is the future. I've been playing for a while and I'm at a pretty high level now, but I can't help to notice that there isn't much left to do at the point that I am. Sure I can level up to infinity. Sure I can talk to people. But there is a lot of repetitiveness and I probably won't stick around for too long. It's too frustrating. The only thing left is to buy fun things with gems so that I can get gold, experience, and some cool rare items. So I decided to grind challenges. And I really did! Actual IRL GRINDING. The result - nothing at all. Why? Because Challenge rewards are luck based and/or rigged most of the time. Sure I did a lotta stuff IRL but not getting rewarded for it in-game kinda ruined it. I don't blame the devs for how Challenge rewards work at all, since rewarding depends on whoever creates the Challenges. But I do think there should be more ways to get gems without paying money. Paying IRL money becomes the only way to continue to have fun at a higher level. That's never a good thing if you want people to stick around. Here are some examples of instances where gem rewards can be implemented: when reaching a certain level, when completing difficult achievements, at a certain number of check-ins, through special in-game events (not RNG based events but events based on the actual effort that you put into tasks, for example). Rewarding the players' efforts is the best way to make them stick around. A balanced relationship between the value of the currency in-game and how difficult it is to get will never stop people from buying it with real money. In many cases it does the opposite. BUT It will also motivate people to progress and continue playing. It's a win win. A lotta people on the app preach the \"it's all about enjoying and improving yourself\" mentality. Sure, but if the aesthetic goal is to \"gamify\" your daily tasks, the app needs to behave like a game, right? And good replayable games are not repetitive and always reward hard work. This might be a bad take and I might be alone on this one but regardless I hope my feedback is useful! and yes, I have no life", "label": ["positive"]}

{"text": "Okay I'm sold, this app has no equal in the Play store and has all the features I always wished for. There are only two things I'm missing: option to remove the Favourite bar (I don't need it at all so it just takes up valuable screen real estate) and an option to change the text colour for the dark theme. It's just too dark. It should be white, not grey.", "label": ["positive"]}

{"text": "This app is the simplest thing yet it makes such a big difference in my daily life. I would only add the option to see the details of each task on the widget (right now it opens the app by default which is not a major issue but It would be an improvement).

{"text": "I really like this app: the way things are organized and how simple it is.

{"text": "Nice app, interface is very user friendly .", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "Awesome reminder app. This one actually motivates you to complete tasks because it shows you your progress and the ui is easy to use. It's very customizable, from being able to choose the icon of a task to allowing you to create an unlimited number of tasks. The free version also allows the use of almost all of its features and doesn't hinder you in any way. I'm considering getting a subscription, but mostly because I want to support the creators of the app that has improved my daily life.", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "Locking option is not available..All other features are excellent.", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "This app has changed the entire course of my life. From health to relationships and productivity. This app is a life saver. One suggestion: regarding habits it would be good if it has all the quotes relating to that habit and so those quotes (maybe along with pictures?) pop up every day on reminder and motivate you. As am example If I want to go to gym, in reminder I am shown random quote written on some inspirational picture.", "label": ["positive"]}

{"text": "Regarding the last review, I noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the \"emptied list\" glitch happening more often. Unrelated, but I really love the idea of the new batch action feature. Just wondering why I can't use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task? I expected that to be the point, but only batch delete and batch skip are available. Batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use, which is that failing takes like 3+ taps", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "Really, really nice app. It is missing some features I'd like to see. For instance, it's sort of hard to schedule your day, so it works better as a to-do list. You can do it, but it's an arduous process. However, the interface is great. You can schedule reminders, and it's worked better for me than other free apps like Trello or ToDoist.", "label": ["positive"]}

I hope this can be rectified soon and I can get back my refund and a pro account. Please fix this fast Update : My problem has been fixed thanks to the Forest team.

{"text": "It's my favourite calendar app. Have used it for years. It has the clearest layout where I can see different things in different colours. I have a lot of health issues and am on a lot of medications etc and because I can colour code things it helps me keep track of everything. It's easy to look back and find things your looking for. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes when I enter a new appointment it erases it. It's the only bug.", "label": ["positive"]}

{"text": "I am a huge fan of Fantastical (on iOS) so I needed an app like it when I got an Android phone. I love the widget and I love the reminders feature!

I like Fantastical's monthly view better.", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "A few days in and so far so good. Definitely has a few non-intuitive functions. Setting custom reminders is weird...a pop-up should just appear to select a date and time, but instead you type it in then it tries to interpret what you type, then you select it if it is right. Very convoluted. Finally found the task completion statistics. Its next to your profile icon/picture when clicking on the three horizontal lines top left. Small circle with squiggly arrow with some numbers next to it.", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "I love this app and all, but I also would really love if making an account here at this app, is free. I found this from a browser extension at chrome. But seriously, if u can make accounts free, this deserves a five stars.", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "Looks like it's not supported anymore. Shame. I used it for about a year and really liked it. Edit - looks like it works again, no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions. Four stars because I liked it while I used it but I have found something better (Loop). Instead of once \"per week\" you can set a goal of once per # of days. Works better for me, and is more useful.", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "it is good , wish it was more accurate with the percentage and provided with an explanation of how to use it", "label": ["positive"]}
{"text": "This app its really good. It looks so colorful for people who colo coordinate their habits. It did help me stay on track for a short while but not in the long run. But this app is worth a try.", "label": ["positive"]}
