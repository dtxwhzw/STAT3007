In general, it is a good tool to have, though, and can help you make a lot of progress on things like household projects, etc., but I really do wish that they'd adjust it so that you can calculate a total for a duration of time longer than a day, and that they would also be conscientious about customer service/support and responding to/fielding correspondence and issues people encounter. ~*Kristin Star*", "label": ["positive"]}

{"text": "Compared to version 1 - poor. Allows for editing one entry of (for example) a weekly appointment, but rather than edit the one instance (as you think you are doing) it creates a new one, so you have a double entry, the original which you can't delete, even after synching. If you've set weekly appointments and one is cancelled, you should be able to edit that one instance without creating a duplicate. I've had this installed for some time now, thinking that the developers would resolve these problems, but although the app has regular 'updates', nothing has changed. Drag and drop defaults to copy, imo should be 'move' by default. If you change an appointment it changes, not duplicates.

Once I decided that I liked the way that it worked, I paid for the pro upgrade. When Business Calendar 2 came out I installed it along side Business Calendar Pro to keep the pro features without an additional payment. I also installed both programs on an Android Tablet. Everything synced with Google Calendar and tasks showed up on both devices. The only issue was that if you entered a repeating task on one device and marked it complete on the other the repetitive task was not created. I realise that this is a Google problem, but you could probably pass this information in the description field if you wanted an enhancement. I recently got a new phone. That is when the tasks quit syncing. I think that a newer version of the apps were installed on the phone than I had been using. I also upgraded the apps on the tablet to see if that would fix the problem.

The app forced there to be a day of the week listed in the repeat schedule, so that it would say something like \"repeat weekly on Thursday on completion date.\" --- Now, having a day of the week and also \"from completion date\" makes no sense, so I was curious what the app would do. I set my Tuesday task to repeat every Thursday from completion date and checked it off on a Sunday. The app should have rescheduled the task for the following Sunday, but it didn't.
