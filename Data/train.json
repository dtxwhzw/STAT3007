Really, if I'm a business person what would I want with an online game for children? 3. You mentioned the apps has to be deployed daily. Tough luck! I did not make your release schedule, you did.

The only issue was that if you entered a repeating task on one device and marked it complete on the other the repetitive task was not created. I realise that this is a Google problem, but you could probably pass this information in the description field if you wanted an enhancement. I recently got a new phone. That is when the tasks quit syncing. I think that a newer version of the apps were installed on the phone than I had been using. I also upgraded the apps on the tablet to see if that would fix the problem. I have just uninstalled the apps from both devices, deleted the tasks from Google Calendar in a web browser, and reinstalled the apps on both devices. I recreated several repeating tasks on the phone. They did not sync to Google Calendar.", "label": ["negative"]}

I'm vacillating between 2 and 3 stars, because the most common thing I need to do (ALWAYS add a task TO THE TOP of a list) is apparently not possible. The most frustrating thing so far is that adding a new task adds it to the BOTTOM of the list, NOT at the top. I NEVER want this behavior. Adding a task at the bottom of the list means the new thing is lost from view and I have to manually rearrange the list. On the web app, you can control where to add a new item by using Shift+A, but there is no preference to ALWAYS do this! There is also no way to do \"Shift+A\" (that I've found) on the Android app. You have to create a task, then manually move it to the top. Also, sorting by date either doesn't work, or sorts the wrong way, because the newest tasks are still at the bottom.

{"text": "This is a re-review. This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: \"A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.\"", "label": ["netural"]}

I need to be able to pull it up on my computer as I'm working to check things off, or see my next scheduled task. By picking up my phone being the only way to check what I need to do, it sets me up for failure, because my phone is a distraction I'm trying to use less while working.

Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?", "label": ["netural"]}

I was all set to subscribe and spend too many hours customizing the experience curve, all of the tasks and their various skills, and really dig into the advanced features, but then I hit the deal breaker. There is no web interface for this app. Everything has to be set up on your phone. I love having notifications and a checklist on my phone to keep up with repeating tasks, habits, and to-dos on the go, but I'm looking for an app to add dozens of things to initially, and continue adding and modifying as time goes on, but to have to do that on my Note 20+ is just something I'm not on board with. I need to be able to pull it up on my computer as I'm working to check things off, or see my next scheduled task. By picking up my phone being the only way to check what I need to do, it sets me up for failure, because my phone is a distraction I'm trying to use less while working. And since I'm working from home now, there's no accountability, so that temptation to check my facebook notifications is strong. If there was a way to open this on a browser (and not through some janky android emulator, or using my chromebook, because I don't use that for work) then I'd already be neck deep in it, but sadly I'm stuck using an app that replaces the reward of tracking real life stat progression with digital outfits for your avatar, something I couldn't care less about.

This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: \"A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader.\"", "label": ["netural"]}

{"text": "Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!", "label": ["netural"]}

{"text": "Is it true that non-premium version soon will loose any way for backup/restore or transfer to another phone? If not true: Please point to me what is the backup/restore way that stays in app in the future. Thanks a lot!. If true: That is really bad news - backup is a basic necessity, so non-premium version will become practically useless on the long term. In addition, premium costs twice as much for a single year than, let's say OsmAnd+ for eternity. And that is a much more complex app + the free version is completely usable within reasonable limits. Tasks is a really nice app (except that swichingt between sublists/lists is unreasonably slow) with some unique and essential features. But this wracks it, it will drive me away. Possibly others too. Not a fair move to reduce base functionality like that. RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S RESPONSE: That is fair enough, except for one important detail: all the people using your free app are now forced to decide - if they want to have a meaningful app - to pay or search for another app. Premium app should only add features and not restrict free app's capabilities. If you add worthwhile features with a fair pricing, people will buy it. Lots of people spent time to set up their tasking system because the app had the right properties for them, now it looks like they were lured into using the app and then forcing them to pay. I payed for a number of apps (all cheaper than yours btw.), and actually my plan was to pay/donate as soon as the slowness of switching between task lists disappear, because I thought the app is really useful and it deserves support. This change is different. I do not mean you should not ask for payment for cloud backup etc., just that you should not remove the free local backup (or any other feature). Or that you should have omitted it from the free version from the start. Best wishes! RESPONSE TO STEVEN NOTTAGE'S SECOND RESPONSE: Actually you can clearly see from my review that I do not want everything for free. My problem is different. If we could not understand each other so far, perhaps it's not worth trying any more. So I won't comment on the rest of your answer. All the best!", "label": ["netural"]}

A bunch of horizontal scrolls is not a problem if instead I have to do a bunch of vertical ones. Looks less intuitive to me. And I can use the go-to option, but I kinda already could and never did.

The problems are, however, that the premium features are very poorly marketed, even on the app's official web page; and I am not ready to put down $16/y on a feature for which I can't evaluate its implementation beforehand.

I can edit the task and set the date as next day,but it would be a nice feature. Would pay extra on top of premium for these. Good work 👍", "label": ["positve"]}

The downside could be an upside for some. When first organizing tasks it can be easy to get overwhelmed with options. No side game to slay dragons like one game to-do list manager I saw.

I broke off my day work to microsoft .to do on a separate device. Any.do now coordinates my consulting and my personal and family tasks, lists, and bills. Its refreshing. I do have syncing issues for calendar events as well as a crash everytime I add people to invites when creating an event. Thats why I gave it 4-stars. Love it for tasks.", "label": ["positve"]}

Having to go to a separate (Agenda) view is a little cumbersome and not immediate as drag'n'drop would be (it took 10 minutes to find the multi-select feature, because of my expectations). However it works and it's better than most of the apps I tried have to offer. -- The rest of the app looks good so far, with nice features and good Tasks integration; I also really like the slider to choose the amount of Week days to visualise 👍.

I did not mean \"tasks\", poor choice of words on my part. I meant that if I have an event at 9pm today, and the time now is 6am, I will not see this at all. The clock face only shows 12 hrs: this makes sense. The list of events below the clock should probably show events for the whole day, though.", "label": ["positve"]}

Having to go into the app to review past or coming days defeats the purpose of the widget, and forces you to use something else other than the widget itself.

{"text": "Basic version works as described; just not what I need. The habits I want to improve require reminders at different times of day. And I'm personally not finding it an effective incentive, especially 'starting over' if missing one time. That's kind of a carrot AND stick approach.

Keep up the good work! ***Update: I'm thrilled to see some of the new features that are being incorporated. This app was really good when I installed it 11 months ago, and is still getting better.

Certainly other details, but as you know Wunderlist is deceased so I can't go back and make a side by side comparison. Note that I don't do the silly thing of rate what I don't like with 1 and what I like with 5. Between 1 and 5 there is the 2,3 and 4 and they should be used. A four is a very good rate.

{"text": "Amazing app. After installing 5-6 todo apps,this wins and stays (beats the popular ones) due to its simplicity. Realy beautifully simple ONE SOLUTION to all my needs - daily routine , shopping list , braindump etc Liked it's customisation ,looks so sweet on my homescreen when it gels in with the background colour. So many colours, font sizes ,transparency. Love the fact that it notes the time when task is completed. helps me in my time tracking and planning Good work Stephen 👍", "label": ["positve"]}

My kid started secondary school in Sept & was struggling to focus while doing homework. The app has helped tremendously and instead of it taking 2+ hours with constant reminders from me to focus it is down to less than an hour and I rarely have to remind them they're doing homework.

{"text": "Just downloaded it, and bought it only to try the multiple-selection feature. I was expecting more actually, hoping to select & move multiple events directly drag'n'dropping from the Week view (when it says \"Tap to select\"), from one day to another (I use it for postponing events that need rescheduling). Having to go to a separate (Agenda) view is a little cumbersome and not immediate as drag'n'drop would be (it took 10 minutes to find the multi-select feature, because of my expectations). However it works and it's better than most of the apps I tried have to offer. -- The rest of the app looks good so far, with nice features and good Tasks integration; I also really like the slider to choose the amount of Week days to visualise 👍. I will update the review when I will have actually tried it further. -- Btw, I'm in Berlin too; if you need some more developer, I might be interested 😊", "label": ["positve"]}

It has absolutely everything I want: - month, week, and day views with hourly breakdown (week and day) - repeating tasks so I don't have to write the same thing over and over - unlimited notes/lists - syncs across devices. I have it on my phone and computer. Best of all, I have it on my work tablet. No more accidently double booking speech sessions! I'm also a hippie and don't think this gets enough love for it's ecofriendly features. - it's all digital = no trash going to landfill - easy color coding = no more multiple plastic pens or washi tape (less clutter in the office/supply bag) - no more physical stickers - multiple covers you can change anytime And it's just so stinking cute!", "label": ["positve"]}

My gripe is with the social aspect, which the app pushes really hard, but its implementation is frustrating. The way to add people to your friend list is to search for their e-mail addresses, which isn't great. Why can't I search by username or referral code? I don't want to share my e-mail address in public spaces, but there doesn't seem to be any way around it. Weirdly enough, you DO get a referral code (and it's what gets shared every time I tweet about my forest), but only five people can use it, and you can only use one other person's code. Plus the code is more about getting other people to download the app than it is adding them to your friend list. The only way to add friends is to know their e-mail. The app even has an achievement where you should get 30 friends, but I don't know a fraction of that many people with whom I'd be comfortable sharing my main address, even though I know a ton of people on social media who use Forest.

{"text": "Great for tracking your bad habits, making new good ones, and building a better lifestyle for yourself. Bought the full version for more habit tracking, which is great if you are dedicated, but $7.99 is a pretty hefty price for just 100 habits, some inspirational quotes, and a mediocre social system.

Another app I tried had the option to drag & drop timelines to reschedule times, e.g. make things a little shorter or longer. It's not an absolute necessity, but I find it a little clunky having to edit each event in turn, although I do love the \"add this gap to previous/next activity\" option. Also, not a necessity but would be a nice touch - I'd love to be able to reorder my routines. Couldn't figure out why they were all in a funny order, but it arranges them alphabetically, and since I make a routine for each day of the week, they were all very jumbled up. I've solved it for now by adding numbers to the start of each name, but again, just slightly clunky. As for the rest, I absolutely adore it. Love the persistent notification; each time I pick my phone up absentmindedly to check my notifications, I see what I'm meant to be doing, and it gets me back on track.

Me: Yes, I've tried that. But making it possible to change the starting day of the week on the browser version (as you can in the app) is apparently not something you want to change. I can only surmise, cause I have not been given any status let alone a confirmation that you've received that request or any request/bug report I've sent. Hence I'm now only wishing, cause I've already tried asking you. Speaking of consistency: Funny you should mention Menu - About - Send Feedback. That \"About\" menu only exists in the app, not on the desktop, and on top of that the \"Send feedback\" does not even exist in the app. It's called \"Report a bug\". In any case, maybe you can send a confirmation in the future at least when request/bug reports are sent that explains what is going to happen with it. Oh, and also \"Report A Bug\" via the app doesn't work (when you don't have a mail app installed I am guessing?). Finding out that you can't even give the proper route as to how to give feedback/bug reports makes me want to substract a star. You've given this canned reply to everyone after all.

It has absolutely everything I want: - month, week, and day views with hourly breakdown (week and day) - repeating tasks so I don't have to write the same thing over and over - unlimited notes/lists - syncs across devices. I have it on my phone and computer. Best of all, I have it on my work tablet. No more accidently double booking speech sessions! I'm also a hippie and don't think this gets enough love for it's ecofriendly features. - it's all digital = no trash going to landfill - easy color coding = no more multiple plastic pens or washi tape (less clutter in the office/supply bag) - no more physical stickers - multiple covers you can change anytime And it's just so stinking cute!", "label": ["positve"]}

The statistics presented to you so you can analyse and change things around in your routine is just a phenomenally useful and an ingenious idea to have there. Everything is just easy and works. I was so impressed when I was setting up my routine, my life, it was like a dream to work with. I cannot recommend this app enough. The developers seem to have delved in to my brain and pulled out exactly the kind of thing that I have always searched for all my life. I can finally say goodbye to the days of trying to organise my life with Excel spreadsheets or having a mini breakdown trying to edit routines on Google calendar without a headache and finally giving up. With TimeTune the details, the functionality, the style, everything, down to the great widget customisation, just... simple, elegant, intuitive, perfect. To the guys/gals who have made this, wherever you are, I shake your hand. Well done on making such an amazing product. All the best for the future - you're going places.

That way i don't get overwhelmed by a single long list but instead have 2 smaller lists. I'm a \"one screen all widgets\" guy.

It would be really nice, if there is an overall progress page to check how am I doing in every Habit, instead of going through every single one of them.

My only disappointment, with the service and not the app, is that I am unable to structure my timeline online on a PC.

{"text": "Good application! One of the best habit tracker applications available on play store. Should have more features.. like authentication by fingerprint scanner, cloud storage, easily accessible sticky notes daily. The Notes option in daily habit calendar can be improved, perhaps adding a separate tab to view daily added notes would be a great idea ! I would have definitely bought premium, if it had cloud auto storage, better functionality for keeping Notes and fingerprint authentication.", "label": ["positve"]}

Now my life isn't as stressful because of last minute projects, personal hygiene, etc. Other apps were good as well, but the alarm feature really just knocked me out of watching random cat videos for 5 hours straight, and actually doing something! Only complaint is that dark mode should be free, and free users should be able to have 10 free habits, but it is all but mild inconveniences. I'm going to buy premium soon, keep it up!", "label": ["positve"]}

I love that I don't have to keep tell them to get to the table anymore. The only thing I would suggest is having the option to make my schedule on the computer too and be able to link the two devises.

Habitica responded: HabitRPG, Inc.December 23, 2020 Hi AFK, thanks for your review! If you'd like to share any further feedback, please feel free to reach out via Menu - About - Send Feedback. Me: Yes, I've tried that. But making it possible to change the starting day of the week on the browser version (as you can in the app) is apparently not something you want to change. I can only surmise, cause I have not been given any status let alone a confirmation that you've received that request or any request/bug report I've sent. Hence I'm now only wishing, cause I've already tried asking you. Speaking of consistency: Funny you should mention Menu - About - Send Feedback. That \"About\" menu only exists in the app, not on the desktop, and on top of that the \"Send feedback\" does not even exist in the app. It's called \"Report a bug\". In any case, maybe you can send a confirmation in the future at least when request/bug reports are sent that explains what is going to happen with it. Oh, and also \"Report A Bug\" via the app doesn't work (when you don't have a mail app installed I am guessing?). Finding out that you can't even give the proper route as to how to give feedback/bug reports makes me want to substract a star. You've given this canned reply to everyone after all.

Please try to improve your performance or revert whatever changes were made that impacted it. Thank you.  Edit: I've tried re-installing, clearing cache, checking how much memory is used (I have 4 gigs and this app's usage is negligible). The lagging started happening after I updated the app. I've now downloaded an older version APK from December 2018. This version runs smoothly like before the update. I'm not sure which update is the one that made the app unusable, since I skipped a few. My main problem is that on the month view, the scrolling is laggy, adding tasks is laggy, everything is laggy. Also, sometimes, for no reason, tasks copy themselves to a new task that is planned for \"all day\" instead of a specific time. I'll up my review from 3 stars to 4.

{"text": "I really love this app, but it's not perfect. Here's my thoughts: Pros: - Allows you to make reminders either a push notification OR AN ALARM. This is VERY hard to find in a reminder app. - Highly flexible and customizable, allowing you to set priority, add sub-tasks, custom snooze lengths, etc. Cons: - Not a super clean interface. - Not always an intuitive interface. - The widget often gets behind. Overall, great for someone looking for a very flexible app, but not for a minimalist.", "label": ["positve"]}

But adding a chart of how you spent your time in the past would be great! Would love to see that feature perhaps on an update of the app!", "label": ["positve"]}
{"text": "Amazing amazing app. All the organisation I could ever need in one place.

Since a few of my routines overlap, it would be amazing if there were an option to see routine titles in the widget timeline above or before the task, in order to keep an overview of which/whose routine is in effect. Both of my children have their own different weekly routines, so it would be nice to see on the timeline, that for example, it's kid#1 who has school on Monday mornings and kid#2 on Monday afternoon instead of two \"time for school\" tasks with no specifics. It would also be great if this app could be accessible from my computer desktop or if I could sync with other family members.", "label": ["positve"]}
